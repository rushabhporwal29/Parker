                      <b> PARKER SHIRTS & TROUSERS</b> is a common man’s brand established by <b> Mr. Shrikant Joshi & Mr. Virendra Joshi</b> in the year 1989 in Pune.  It is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of PARKER products. They manufacture shirts and trousers of different varieties in their production unit named as <b> MAHALAXMI APPARELS </b>.

                      Their main aim is to satisfy the middle class consumers by selling good quality garments at reasonable rates. They inaugurated their first outlet in Pune in which they highlighted the rates of the products which were incomparable to the current market price. Good quality shirts were introduced from the range of Rs. 60 onwards and Trousers from Rs.80 onwards. This move helps them gain a large market share and establish their presence in Pune. Within a year they inaugurated the second mega outlet in the market place of Pune (Laxmi road). They kept a low margin and aimed for a higher volume of customers. This strategy was consistently used which resulted in improved customer loyalty. This response encouraged the company to spread it branches all over Maharashtra.

                  For the retailers it can be the best option for franchising Parker as it has set a distinct image in consumers mind.

                    They also gives a wide selection of clothing’s to the retailers and the products are supplied according to their preferences and according to the trend which is followed in the particular area.

Hence this shows the variation in the taste of the consumers in various regions. This system helps to reduce the dead stock in store and the retailer can be in touch with recent trend of particular market.
